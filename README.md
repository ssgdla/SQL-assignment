1. When a customer updates their contact phone number, what query should we run in order to save that update to the database?

    Assume the customer_id is 101 and new number is 123456789. Then we can use the the SQL in file: 1.sql to update 

2. We've noted that the phone number update feature in the web application is too slow, and have identified that the update query is the primary bottleneck. What could we do to speed up this query?

    We can add a new index based on customer_id. SQL to alter table can be found in 2.sql

3. number of subscribers whose subscriptions will be ending in 2023

    The query can be found in 3.sql

4. number of subscribers who have subscribed for more than 3 months in 2022

    The query can be found in 4.sql

5. subscribers who have subscribed for more than two products

    The query can be found in 5.sql

6. product with the most/2ndmost/3rdmost number of subscribers in 2022

    The query can be found in 6.sql

7. number of subscribers who have re-subscribed more than once for each product

    The query can be found in 7.sql

8. subscribers who have re-subscribed a higher version of the product in 2023 - for example Autocad 2022 to Autocad 2023

    The query can be found in 8.sql
